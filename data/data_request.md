# Request for data

## Introduction

We are researching the tracking of fermentation (beer/cider/wine/kombucha/etc)
by listening to the, and using machine learning to count the plops from the airlock.

For this to be a realistic evaluation we need data that captures the
large amount of variety in the fermentation process, such as
- different airlocks
- different stages of fermentation
- different intensities of fermentation/CO2 production
- different recording devices
- different background noises

Our initial goal is to capture at least 100 sound clips. An ideal amount would be to get over 1000.
And therefore we are seeking your help!

We are planning to compile the submissions into a machine learning dataset,
that can be used by Audio Machine Learning researchers across the world.
Any data that is released will be anonymous.

To support the effort we will be giving away 3 Plaato Airlocks to those that submit.
The draw will be made randomly based on submissions.
So those that have a larger amount of submissions will increase their chances.

## Instructions

Looking for realistic sound from typical brewing conditions, not hi-fidelity audio.
It is not a problem if there are other naturally noises around.
In fact if that is the typical case, please leave those noise sources in.

We are primarily looking for audio of fermentation in progress.
It can be anywhere in the process, from just getting started, to very active CO2 generation, to fading down.
But people can submit up to 3 clips from when not brewing.

Multiple submissions are welcomed!
Each submission should be recorded at least 1 hour apart.

- Make a 1-2 minute recording of audio where you have your brew during fermentation.
- Record using a standard phone/tablet or digital camera.
- Record from a distance between 10 cm to 1 meter from airlock.
- Make note of the type of airlock used, how many hours since fermentation start

Try to avoid too much handling noise when operating the phone/camera/recorder.

Before submitting

Listen through the audio file
- Make sure there is nothing private in the audio file
- Make a note of how clearly the plops can be hear

Submitting

Submit the data via this Google Form.


Certify that the data collected is my own, and I have the full rights to submit it.
Agree that the data maybe used for research or commercial purposes.
Data may be published in anonymized form.


## TODO

- Make a submission form
- Find a 
- Polish the instructions
- Test the instructions / submissions oneself
- Test the instructions/submission on another person
- Publish in relevant channels

## Metadata to capture

- Are there brews actively fermenting in this clip?
No. Yes 1, Yes multiple
- How clearly can bubbling of the airlock be heard?
not at all / nothing to hear
hard to hear
ok easily heard
very easily heard

- Type of airlock.
S-curve/2-piece, 3-piece, other, dont know
- What are you brewing
- Hours since start of brew

- How did you find this call-for-data?
- Do you want to get updates about project by email (max every few months)
- Would you be interested in a phone or web app that tracks fermentation rate? Why / why not
- Any tips, comments or other inputs

Annotations to do after submission

- Number of bubbles counted. BPM


## Submission form

TypeForm seems to allow audio upload. 10 MB limit
1 minute mono audio
5.76 MB (megabytes) as raw WAV
1.92 MB (megabytes) with 256 kbits/s compressed

Need some CAPTA / trolling checking
